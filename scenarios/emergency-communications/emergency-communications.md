## Purpose

Exercise PromiseGrid design candidates against emergency-communications application
pressure: Intermittent connectivity, priority messages, responder trust, and degraded-
mode operation.

## Setup

Alice depends on an outcome in the Emergency Communications domain. Bob makes promises
about intermittent connectivity, priority messages, responder trust, and degraded-mode
operation. Carol needs enough evidence to rely on Bob's promise without having complete
global state, and Mallory may exploit stale, missing, or ambiguous evidence.

## Stimulus

A routine application event becomes contested or incomplete. Some relevant objects,
signatures, observations, or relationship records are delayed, partitioned, stale, or
disputed, and each peer must decide what to accept, retry, downgrade, or escalate using
only local evidence.

## Expected Pressure

The candidate simulation must show which promises, CAS objects, feeds, identity claims,
names, and promise accounting records are needed for this application pressure, while
avoiding hidden global state or a central authority that would make the result non-
comparable.
