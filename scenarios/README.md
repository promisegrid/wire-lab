# Root Scenarios

Root `scenarios/` entries are wire-lab comparison apparatus. They describe
pressure that multiple simulations can be run against; they are not PromiseGrid
node layout, production API, shared protocol components, or simulation-local
world state. Source: `DI-faros`; `DI-vabor`; `DI-dimas`; `DI-kizal`.

## Directory Shape

Each root scenario entry uses this shape:

```text
scenarios/
  <scenario-id>/
    <scenario-id>.md
```

- `<scenario-id>` is stable kebab-case.
- Application entries use one `scenarios/<application-id>/` directory per
  application, such as `scenarios/bgp-routing/`.
- Mined simulation rows use one root scenario entry per source row, transformed
  for cross-simulation comparison and linked back to the source
  `simulations/.../SCENARIOS.md` row.
- Per-scenario `README.md` files are intentionally absent. Shared scenario
  contract prose lives here so API prompts can reuse the same cacheable context,
  while `scenarios/<scenario-id>/<scenario-id>.md` files carry only
  scenario-specific pressure. Source: `DI-kizal`.
- Result evidence lives only under
  `results/<sim-id>/<scenario-id>/<model-id>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md`. Generate
  scan tables from that result tree when needed. Source: `DI-zamin`.

## Scenario Entry Template

Use this template for each scenario markdown file:

```markdown
# <Scenario Title>

## Scenario ID

<stable-kebab-case-id>

## Source / Provenance

- Source type: application seed | mined simulation row | new harness scenario
- Source path:
- Source row/title:
- Source DI / TODO / TE:

## Purpose

<What design pressure this scenario applies.>

## Setup

<Initial state, promises, artifacts, sites, policies, and sparse knowledge.>

## Stimulus

<The event or request that exercises the scenario.>

## Expected Pressure

<What the scenario should force a candidate design to explain.>

## Scenario-Specific Evaluation Questions

- <Only questions unique to this scenario, if any.>
```

Do not duplicate the common actors, applicability, goal checks, result-path
shape, or authority boundary in each scenario file. Those shared rules are part
of this root scenario contract. Source: `DI-kizal`.

## Shared Applicability

Every scenario can be applied to any simulation that claims to address its
application domain, source-row pressure, or underlying PromiseGrid design
question. A result may conclude that the simulation intentionally does not cover
the scenario, but the run should still make the boundary explicit. Source:
`DI-kizal`.

## Actor Convention

Use Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Ellen, Frank, and Mallory where named actors help
make promises, failures, sparse knowledge, or adversarial pressure concrete.
Alice normally depends on the outcome, Bob makes or relays promises, Carol
audits or relies on evidence, and Mallory represents adversarial, captured,
stale, or misleading evidence when that pressure is relevant. Source:
`DI-034-20260508-060134`; `DI-kizal`.

## Scenario Quality Gates

Every root scenario run must explicitly test the 100-year PromiseGrid goal and
other overarching PromiseGrid goals. A scenario may be small, but it must not be
narrow in a way that accidentally assumes away the conditions PromiseGrid is
meant to survive. Source: `DI-botup`; `DI-kizal`.

At minimum, each run should address:

- **100-year durability:** Does the scenario still make sense after tools,
  organizations, keys, people, and infrastructure have changed?
- **Sparse, partial knowledge:** Does it avoid assuming any peer has the whole
  graph, all CAS objects, or globally complete state?
- **No central authority or registry:** Does it avoid relying on a central pCID,
  identity, trust, naming, routing, currency, or governance authority unless the
  point of the scenario is to test that failure mode?
- **Peer-local promise accounting:** Does it show what Alice, Bob, Carol, or
  another peer can observe and record locally?
- **Adversarial or failure pressure:** Does it include Mallory, corruption,
  refusal, stale data, partition, capture, default, or another failure mode when
  relevant?
- **Human and LLM auditability:** Can a later person or model understand what
  was promised, what happened, and why the result matters?
- **Migration / evolution path:** Does it expose what happens when protocols,
  keys, names, object shapes, policies, or organizations evolve?

If a gate is not relevant, the result should say why instead of omitting it.

## Common Evaluation Questions

Every scenario run should answer these common questions unless a
scenario-specific question narrows them:

- Which promises, CAS objects, feeds, identity claims, names, promise accounting
  records, or protocol claims does the candidate simulation need?
- What can Alice, Bob, Carol, Mallory, or another peer observe and record locally
  after the stimulus?
- Does the candidate design preserve the expected pressure without appealing to
  hidden global state or central authority?
- Which assumptions would make the run fail the 100-year, sparse-knowledge, or
  no-central-authority goals?
- What DR, DI, frozen spec, TODO, TE, or guide handoff would the evidence inform?

## Result Runs

Result runs live under:

`results/<sim-id>/<scenario-id>/<model-id>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md`

Committed scenario entries are input context, not result summaries. Do not add a
`MATRIX.md` file to a scenario directory. To inspect run evidence, generate a
view from the canonical result tree:

```bash
cd tools/matrix-runner
go run . view -repo-root ../.. -scenario <scenario-id>
```

The generated view is derived evidence navigation. It does not declare a winning
design by itself, and it should not be committed as scenario source state.
Source: `DI-zamin`.

## Authority Boundary

Scenarios and result runs are evidence only. Design authority still graduates
through DR, DI, frozen spec, or PromiseGrid Development Guide handoff. Source:
`DI-faros`; `DI-kizal`.

## Population Plan

`TODO-dadub` owns the initial population plan. The first mining pass created one
root entry per existing sim-local scenario row under `DI-nanih`, the first
application-seed pass created one root entry per seed application under
`DI-midif`, and the cache cleanup pass removed per-scenario boilerplate under
`DI-kizal`. Future entries should follow this shared-contract shape unless a
later DI changes the root scenario contract.
