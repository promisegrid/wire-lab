## Purpose

Exercise PromiseGrid design candidates against federated-identity-credentials
application pressure: Issuer trust, credential presentation, revocation, selective
disclosure, and verifier policy.

## Setup

Alice depends on an outcome in the Federated Identity Credentials domain. Bob makes
promises about issuer trust, credential presentation, revocation, selective disclosure,
and verifier policy. Carol needs enough evidence to rely on Bob's promise without having
complete global state, and Mallory may exploit stale, missing, or ambiguous evidence.

## Stimulus

A routine application event becomes contested or incomplete. Some relevant objects,
signatures, observations, or relationship records are delayed, partitioned, stale, or
disputed, and each peer must decide what to accept, retry, downgrade, or escalate using
only local evidence.

## Expected Pressure

The candidate simulation must show which promises, CAS objects, feeds, identity claims,
names, and promise accounting records are needed for this application pressure, while
avoiding hidden global state or a central authority that would make the result non-
comparable.
