# Grid Envelope Variant Spec (DRAFT)

> **Status: DRAFT.** Not frozen. The pCID for this spec is not yet minted.
> Variant: `enc-dag-cbor` / `unknown-opaque` / `sig-mandatory-opaque-bytes`.
> Source: `DI-fanah`.

## Purpose

This spec defines one full positional grid-envelope candidate for wire-lab
comparison. It is a specimen inside `SIM-ruzil-grid-envelope-enc-dag-cbor-unknown-opaque-sig-mandatory-opaque-bytes`, not a harness rule and not the
canonical PromiseGrid wire format.

## Positional Envelope Shape

The envelope shape for this variant is:

```text
[pcid, payload, signature]
```

Slots are interpreted positionally:

- `pcid` identifies the protocol/spec/handler that interprets `payload`.
- `payload` is opaque bytes until interpreted by the handler named by `pcid`.
- `signature` is mandatory opaque bytes over the canonical unsigned prefix.

A `payload` may itself be the canonical bytes of another grid envelope when the
protocol named by `pcid` specifies recursive nesting. The outer grid envelope
does not prescribe the payload's internal organization beyond the bytes boundary.

## Encoding

This variant encodes the envelope as DAG-CBOR-compatible positional arrays. `pcid` and `sig_pcid`, when present, are DAG-CBOR Link values; `payload`, `signature`, and `sig_payload` are byte strings. The envelope remains positional: no map/object envelope fields are introduced. The canonical bytes for signing and hashing are the DAG-CBOR bytes of the exact positional array under this spec.

## Unknown pCID Policy

If a receiver lacks a handler for `pcid`, it may store and forward the exact envelope bytes as opaque content, but interpretation fails with an explicit unsupported-pCID result. A receiver MUST NOT parse `payload` speculatively without the handler named by `pcid`.

## Signature and Authorship Policy

The third positional slot, `signature`, is mandatory opaque bytes. The bytes cover the canonical unsigned prefix `[pcid, payload]` under this variant's encoding. The envelope layer enforces presence and byte-string shape; signature algorithm, signer identity, and verification semantics are determined by the protocol ecosystem being tested with this variant.

## Layering-Test Behavior

This variant answers the harness §1.3 layering scenarios as follows:

- Ordering disagreements are handled by the protocol named by `pcid`; the grid
  envelope only preserves the bytes and dispatch identity needed to make failures
  explicit.
- Forwarding, relay, or hop-local evidence is represented either by wrapper
  grid envelopes, by the payload protocol, or by the signature slots available in
  this variant.
- External or content-addressed body references live inside `payload` under the
  protocol named by `pcid`; the envelope can carry those payload bytes without
  understanding them.
- Incompatible interpretation rules fail visibly at the `pcid` dispatch boundary
  or under this variant's unknown-pCID policy.

## Non-Goals

This draft does not declare a winning envelope, does not define a central pCID
registry, does not freeze a final PromiseGrid signing scheme, and does not make
sibling grid-envelope variants obsolete.

## Freeze Gate

This draft can freeze only after at least one simulation run compares it against
sibling positional grid-envelope variants and Steve signs a merge/freeze promise
for this specific specimen.
